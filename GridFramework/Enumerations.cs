namespace GridFramework {
	/// <summary>Radians or degrees.</summary>
	/// This is a simple enum for specifying whether an angle is given in

	/// GFPolarGrid, but I decided to make it global in case other grids in the

	/// <summary>Enum for one of the three grid planes.</summary>
	/// This enum encapsulates the three grid planes: XY, XZ and YZ. You can
	/// also get the integer of enum items, where the integer corresponds to
	/// the missing axis (X = 0, Y = 1, Z = 2):
	/// <code>
	/// 	// UnityScript:
	/// 	var myPlane: GridPlane = GridPlane.XZ;
	/// 	var planeIndex: int = (int)myPlane; // sets the variable to 1
	/// 	
	/// 	// C#
	/// 	GridPlane myPlane = GridPlane.XZ;
	/// 	int planeIndex = (int)myPlane;
	/// </code>
	public enum GridPlane {YZ, XZ, XY};
