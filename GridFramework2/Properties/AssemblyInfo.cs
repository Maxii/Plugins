// The AssemblyCultureAttribute is used by compilers to distinguish between a main assembly and a satellite assembly. 
// A main assembly contains code and the neutral culture's resources. A satellite assembly contains only resources for a 
// particular culture, as in [assembly:AssemblyCulture("de")]. Putting this attribute on an assembly and using something 
// other than the empty string ("") for the culture name will make this assembly look like a satellite assembly, rather than
// a main assembly that contains executable code. Labeling a traditional code library with this attribute will break it,
// because no other code will be able to find the library's entry points at runtime.
