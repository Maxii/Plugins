/** Linearly interpolating movement script.
 * This movement script will follow the path exactly, it uses linear interpolation to move between the waypoints in the path.
 * This is desirable for some types of games.
 * It also works in 2D.
 *
 * Recommended setup:
 *
 * This depends on what type of movement you are aiming for.
 * If you are aiming for movement where the unit follows the path exactly (you are likely using a grid or point graph)
 * the default settings on this component should work quite well, however I recommend that you adjust the StartEndModifier
 * on the Seeker component: set the 'Exact Start Point' field to 'NodeConnection' and the 'Exact End Point' field to 'SnapToNode'.
 *
 * If you on the other hand want smoother movement I recommend adding the Simple Smooth Modifier to the GameObject as well.
 * You may also want to tweak the #rotationSpeed.
